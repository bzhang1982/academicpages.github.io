## The GAMERA MHD code

Yes Gamera is a giant Japanese turtle, for us it's just a piece of elegant code that solves the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in non-orthogonal, curvilinear grids. Gamera stands for "Grid Agnostic MHD for Extended Research Applications" Here's the "official" design of the Gamera logo by artist at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU/APL).
