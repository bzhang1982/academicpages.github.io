Welcome to my page on the web!

Who Am I
======
I'm a space physicist working on the development of first-principles, high-performance computing based numerical tools for understanding the dynamic evolution of our space environment, a.k.a., the geospace, The changing geospace environment affects activities such as communication and operation of space systems, which is known as space weather. The computational tools developed through my research projects are potentially promising for the prediction of space weather that impacts our daily life.

What I'm working on
=====
Started from a pioneer MHD code called the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM), my colleagues at Johns Hopkins University and I have developed a general-purposed code GAMERA (the LFM re-invented, name after a prominent Japanese Kaiju) solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). GAMERA stays mostly inside the solar system, occupying the Solar corona, Inner Heliosphere, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn Neptune. Maybe Mars, Uranus in the future.

Join us as a PhD student

Prospective Students: The GAMERA team is always on the lookout for eager, self-motivated individuals. Please skim these pages to get an idea of our wide-ranging research endeavors. If these projects interest you, or you have independent ideas to discuss, please contact me.
